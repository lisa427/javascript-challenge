# javascript-challenge

* The index.html file is a website that takes a dataset (Javascript array) and renders a table to show the data.  

* A filter for the date was created, which will filter the data and render the table to show only the data for that date.  

* In order to allow the user to easily see the entire dataset again after filtering, a "Clear Filter" button was added.  When clicked, a table of the entire dataset will be shown again.  

## Bonus

* Another index.html file was created in the bonus folder.

* This website has 5 possible filters.  All 5 filters can be filled out at once, or some can be left blank if the user only wants to filter on some of the criteria.  (For example, if only 2 filters are filled out and the others left blank, the data will be filtered on just those 2 criteria).

* A table will be rendered to show the filtered data.

* The user can easily see the entire dataset again by clicking the "Clear Filter" button.
